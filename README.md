Ludum Dare is one of the world's largest and longest running Game Jam events. Every 4 months, they challenge creators to make a game from scratch in a weekend. On Friday, April 20th, they announced the theme. *Combine 2 Incompatible Genres*. We had until Monday, April 23rd (exactly 72 hours), to make a game. We spend about an hour going over themes before we landed on **FPS + Golf**. Here are some of our rejected ideas that you can totally use to make a game, if you do please hit us up I would love to play it.

* FPS + Soccer 
* FPS + Cookie Clicker (Our idea was to have CC affect damage and health)
* Tetris Text Adventure (Play tetris but with only dos prompt text telling you the shape of the block and where it is, show a replay with a normal tetris view)
* Pinball Text Adventure
* JRPG style turn based FPS
* Cookie Clicker Racing Game
