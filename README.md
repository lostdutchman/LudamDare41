Ludum Dare is one of the world's largest and longest running Game Jam events. Every 4 months, they challenge creators to make a game from scratch in a weekend. On Friday, April 20th, they announced the theme. *Combine 2 Incompatible Genres*. We had until Monday, April 23rd (exactly 72 hours), to make a game. We spend about an hour going over themes before we landed on **FPS + Golf**. Here are some of our rejected ideas that you can totally use to make a game, if you do please hit us up I would love to play it.

* FPS + Soccer 
* FPS + Cookie Clicker (Our idea was to have CC affect damage and health)
* Tetris Text Adventure (Play tetris but with only dos prompt text telling you the shape of the block and where it is, show a replay with a normal tetris view)
* Pinball Text Adventure
* JRPG style turn based FPS
* Cookie Clicker Racing Game

If you want to use this code base to make your own game feel free, it is absolutely free to use so long as you are not making a propaganda game(No racist, Sexist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Xenophobic.. Ect.. content. If you want to make that kind of trash then Iâ€™m not here to save you 72 hrs of work). Please also remove our logo/splash screen if you decide to publish this. If you need further clarification reach out to us.
